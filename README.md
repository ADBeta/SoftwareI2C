# SoftwareI2C
Software bit-banging I2C library for Arduino

This library is still a Work In Progress. Feel free to improve it as you see fit.

The library is designed to defer heavy calculations to idle-time and be very light while communicating.
This - and the fact that some don't have hardware I2C - This makes it perfect for ATTiny devices.

Additionally it allows use of multiple devices that have clashing I2C Addresses
